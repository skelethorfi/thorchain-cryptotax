# Loans (THORChain lending)

## Summary

Loan opens and repayments are Midgard `swap` actions with `txType` `loanOpen`
or `loanRepayment`. The exporter normally skips actions that are not
`success`. Two exceptions apply:

- **Loan repayments** that are `pending`: Midgard keeps a repayment pending
  until the loan is closed, but the repayment itself happened.
- **Loan opens with an output** that are `pending`: an output means the loan
  was paid out. In practice these are loans that borrowed RUNE, which Midgard
  reports as pending although they were paid (see below).

Pending loan opens with no output are skipped.

## Why a pending loan open with an output counts as success

Midgard adds an output when it records the payout. For loans paid out on
another chain, that is also when the action becomes `success`, so no such loan
is pending with an output. RUNE payouts are recorded without a txid, and those
actions stay `pending` although the output (the payout) is there. The rule is
therefore "an output means it was paid", not "RUNE is special"; the evidence:

Checked on 2026-10-01 against 3,000 public loan opens from Midgard (via
Liquify), January to September 2024, while lending was operating normally:

| Status | Borrowed | Outbound txid | Count |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| success | non-RUNE asset | yes | 2,657 |
| **pending** | **RUNE** | **no** | **325** |
| success | RUNE | yes (15), no (1) | 16 |
| pending | nothing recorded | no | 2 |

- `pending` tracks **RUNE payouts**, not failed loans. RUNE is paid out natively
  on THORChain, and Midgard records that payout without a txid, so it never
  marks those loan opens complete. Loans of any other asset are never pending,
  so every pending loan open with an output borrowed RUNE.
- **The loans were paid.** THORNode has pruned these transactions (even the
  successful ones), so payouts were checked with Midgard's borrower records
  (`/v2/borrower/<address>`): all 26 pending RUNE loan opens whose borrower has
  only that one loan have debt issued against it. None have zero.
- **Statuses change after the fact.** At least one RUNE loan open was reported
  as `success` in September 2024 and has been `pending` in every snapshot since
  December 2024. Exports made at different times can disagree unless pending
  RUNE loan opens are included.

### Edge case: pending with no output

Of the 2 pending loan opens with no output recorded, the one that can be
checked (a single-loan borrower) also has debt issued, so Midgard sometimes
omits the payout entirely. These are still skipped: without an output there is
no amount to export, and a borrower's debt is a per-address total, which can't
be attributed to one loan when the borrower has several.

## Rows

| Action | Rows |
| --- | --- |
| Loan open | `CollateralDeposit` (collateral sent in, with the inbound fee) and `Loan` (amount borrowed, no fee) |
| Loan repayment | `LoanRepayment` (amount sent in, with the inbound fee) and, when the loan closes, `CollateralWithdrawal` (no fee) |

Fees follow `fees.md`.
