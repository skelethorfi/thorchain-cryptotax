# Source data snapshots

A tax return rests on what Midgard, THORNode, Viewblock and the TCY endpoint
returned when the data was fetched. That changes after the fact:

- THORNode prunes old txs, so a later fetch can come back without the tx or
  its gas.
- Pending actions and txs (an unfinished loan repayment, a refund, an
  outbound not yet sent) are later finalised.
- Midgard instances and revisions change old actions (the loan-open amount
  fix), and history gets archived (the 2022-03-22 `genesisTx` migration).

So the tool keeps every version of every record it has fetched. Each run
picks the right version of each record, and lists what it used.

## The store

`src/cache/RecordStore.ts`, under the config's `storePath` (default `store/`
next to the config, ignored by git in this repo). Several configs, e.g. one
per tax year, can share one store, because copies are only ever added:

```
records/midgard/2025/07/swap.192D…296D.0.json      an action's first copy, in its month (UTC)
records/midgard/2025/07/swap.192D…296D.1.json      a later copy that differs
records/viewblock/2025/07/192D…296D.0.json         a Viewblock tx, in its month
records/tcy/2025/05/<wallet>.1746566872.0.json     a TCY distribution, in its month
records/thornode/2025/07/192D…296D.0.json          a THORNode tx status, in its action's month
records/thornode-cosmos/2026/05/E703…6721.0.json   a Cosmos tx, in its block time's month
lists/midgard/<wallet>.0.json                      the record keys one fetch of a wallet returned
```

- The file name is the record's key, then `.<n>` (0, 1, …) for each copy: the
  copy number is always the last number, so a key may end in one (TCY's
  `<wallet>.<date>.0.json`). Copies beyond `.9` list out of order (`.10` before
  `.2`); that is cosmetic, as copies are ordered by fetch time.
  Letters, digits and `. _ + -` are kept; anything else is `%XX`, so the name
  decodes back to the key (a contract's `/` is `%2F`).
- A copy is `{source, key, fetchedAt, url, importedFrom, sha256, data}`; a list
  is `{source, wallet, fetchedAt, url, importedFrom, keys}`.
- The month comes from the record's own date (action date, tx timestamp,
  distribution date, Cosmos block time). A THORNode tx status has none, so it
  takes the date of the action it was fetched for; the importer dates old
  files by the stored Midgard action with that inbound txid. With no date at
  all, a record goes in `undated/`.
- A record's later copies stay in its first copy's folder, even if a revision
  changes its date, so a path never moves once a manifest points at it. The
  date only decides where a record is first filed: lookups use the name scan.
- A run finds every copy with one scan of the file names, so it doesn't need a
  record's date to find it. The scan refuses two keys that differ only in case,
  which macOS and Windows can't keep apart.
- Copies are ordered by `fetchedAt` (unknown, for copies imported from old
  caches, first, in import order), then by number. The number is only unique:
  an old copy imported after a newer fetch still counts as older.
- A new copy takes the next free number with an exclusive create, so two runs
  sharing a store never overwrite each other.

| Source | Record | Key |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `midgard`, `maya-midgard` | an action | `<type>.<first txid>`; a contract action adds its event (one wasm call gives several); `<type>.date-<date>` with no txid |
| `thornode` | a tx status | txid |
| `thornode-cosmos` | a Cosmos tx (contract calls) | txid |
| `viewblock` | a tx | its hash |
| `tcy` | a distribution | `<wallet>.<date>` (one a day; several wallets are paid on the same day) |

An action or tx is shared: a swap between two of my wallets is stored once, and
both wallets' lists point at it. A TCY distribution belongs to one wallet, so
its key includes the wallet. On the FY26 data, 12 txids have more than one
action (e.g. a send and a swap); type and txid tell them apart, and only
contract actions need their event. If two records of one wallet fetch ever
share a key, the run stops rather than merge them.

- A fetched record is stored only if it differs from its latest copy. Nothing
  is overwritten or deleted.
- Before the comparison, each source drops fields that change on every fetch
  but are not source data: Viewblock's `usdNew` (value at today's price; `usd`,
  the value at the time of the tx, is kept), TCY's `apr` and `total`, and
  THORNode's `blocks_since_scheduled` for an outbound never signed (a switch).
- `npm run store -- import <store> <old cache or store>...` copies every version
  into a store, oldest first (a copy from an old cache has no fetch time, so
  the import order is the order of its copies). It reads old caches
  (`<source>/<key>.json` with a whole response), stores in the earlier
  folder-per-record layout (re-keyed), and stores in this layout. Each copy
  from an old cache has `importedFrom`, the file it came from. Identical
  copies are skipped. Old Midgard's `genesisTx` placeholder adds (positions
  that existed at its 2022-03-22 store migration) are left out: Midgard's
  archive has the real adds, and keeping both would count those positions
  twice. An old cache is not read unless imported.

## Which copy a run uses

Copies are compared oldest first. Each later copy becomes the one used, unless
it has less in it:

| Case | Stored | Used | Manifest `choice` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| One copy | – | it | `only` |
| Pending, then finalised | new copy | the finalised copy | `finalised` |
| Pruned (THORNode lost the tx or its gas; a Cosmos tx lost its events) | new copy, as evidence | **the earlier, fuller copy** | `kept-over-pruned` |
| Changed otherwise (a revision) | new copy | the new copy, and the run lists it | `revised` |
| In an earlier fetch of the wallet, but not the latest | – | the earlier copy, and the run lists it | `missing: true` |

Revisions use the new copy (decided 2026-10-03): those seen so far are
corrections. A filed year is not affected, because it replays its own manifest.

## Run modes

| Run | Fetches | Uses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| default | every wallet list again (new activity, changed or missing records), every record still pending, and anything not stored yet | the chosen copy of each record, with this run's fetches included |
| `--refetch-all` | also every finalised record again, THORNode and Cosmos txs included | the same |
| `--offline` | nothing; anything not stored is an error | the chosen copy |
| `--replay <run>` | nothing | exactly the copies in that run's `snapshots.json`, checked against their hashes |

A finalised record (a THORNode tx, a Cosmos tx) can only come back revised or
pruned, and the store keeps the earlier copy either way, so a default run
leaves it alone. `--refetch-all` checks every record, e.g. before filing a
year, to see what the sources have changed since. A pending one (a stage not
completed) is fetched again on every run, until a finalised copy is stored.

A wallet list is the wallet's whole history, because the sources page from
the first action, so a run sees new activity and changes to old actions in
one pass. A record shared by several wallets is fetched once per
run.

Each fetch is retried after a transient error (HTTP 5xx or 429, a connection
reset, a timeout, a DNS failure), waiting 5 s, 20 s and then 60 s
(`src/utils/Retry.ts`), and a request that hangs fails after 60 s. A run that
still fails keeps what it stored so far, and can be run again.

### Config names

- `storePath` (default `store/` next to the config) was `cachePath`. The old
  name still works, with a warning.
- `cacheDataSources` is no longer used, and a run warns if it is set. `true`
  used to reuse the cache, and `false` deleted it before each run; now every
  run fetches the latest data and keeps what was stored. Use `--offline` (or
  `--replay`) to fetch nothing, e.g. to re-run a filed year.

## The manifest (snapshot)

Each run writes `snapshots.json` to its output folder, with `layout: 3` (a
manifest from an earlier layout is refused, as its paths no longer exist):

- `records`: for each record used, the source, key, copy file (relative to
  `storePath`), `fetchedAt`, `url`, `sha256`, `choice`, the number of copies
  stored, `missing` if it was kept from an earlier fetch, and `fetched` if
  this run fetched it (`new`, `changed`, `unchanged`).
- `lists`: for each wallet and source, the record keys used, in order, and
  which of them were missing from the latest fetch.

The run prints a summary: records fetched (new, changed, unchanged), and
records finalised, revised, kept over a pruned copy, or missing. It lists the
records this run found changed, and those the sources no longer return; the
choices made on earlier runs are in the manifest. A manifest is the snapshot: it points only at copies that never
change, so `--replay` reproduces the run exactly.

## Filing a year (separate work)

To be designed on top of this: when a year is filed, keep its manifest as the
year's record (e.g. `filed.json`) and commit it with the store, so the filed
output can always be replayed. Several years' configs may share one store,
because copies are only ever added.
