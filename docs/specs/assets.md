# Asset names

Midgard writes assets as `CHAIN<separator>ASSET`. The separator tells where
the asset lives:

| Midgard | Kind | Lives on | Exported currency | Blockchain column |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BTC.BTC` | L1 asset | its own chain (Bitcoin) | `BTC` | `BTC` |
| `THOR.RUNE`, `THOR.RUJI` | native THORChain token | THORChain | `RUNE`, `RUJI` | `THORChain` |
| `BTC/BTC` | synth | THORChain | `ThorSynth.BTC.BTC` | `THORChain` |
| `BTC~BTC` | trade asset | THORChain | `BTC` (the L1 asset's name) | `THORChain` |
| `BTC-BTC`, `ETH-USDC-0X…` | secured asset | THORChain | `BTC`, `USDC` (the L1 asset's name) | `THORChain` |
| `X/RUJI` | Cosmos denom on THORChain (`x/ruji`), not a synth | THORChain | `RUJI` | `THORChain` |

On Maya the synth prefix is `Maya` (`MayaSynth.BTC.BTC`) and the blockchain is
Maya's.

Every row follows the Blockchain column above, whatever its type: swaps, fees,
liquidity deposits and withdrawals, and sends alike. A protocol's own chain is
always its name (`THORChain`, `MayaProtocol`), never Midgard's chain id
(`THOR`, `MAYA`); an L1 chain keeps Midgard's id (`BTC`, `KUJI`).

Why:

- Summ recognises `THORChain` and attaches the row to its THORChain chain. It
  does not recognise `THOR`: such a row gets no chain at all, which is worse
  than a blank column, because for a blank one Summ infers the chain from the
  wallet. The row's amounts and prices are unaffected; the chain is what
  Summ's transfer matching and per-chain views use.
- A synth is pool-backed exposure to another chain's asset, a different
  holding from that asset and held on a different chain. If both export as
  `BTC`, Summ mixes their balances and cost bases. The prefix says where it
  lives; `<chain>.<asset>` says what it gives exposure to. It is the same
  `<prefix>.<chain>.<asset>` shape as liquidity tokens (`ThorLP.BTC.BTC`) and
  savers tokens (`ThorSavers.BTC.BTC`, `savers.md`). No `/`: a slash in a
  currency breaks Summ's ledger view.
- Trade and secured assets are the L1 asset held 1:1 on THORChain, like a
  bridged token on another chain, so they keep the L1 asset's name with
  THORChain as the blockchain. Moving an asset into or out of them is still
  exported as a swap today; exporting it as a bridge (not a disposal) is an
  open item.
- Native THORChain tokens use their ticker, as Summ prices them: `RUNE`,
  `TCY`, `RUJI`. `x/ruji` in contract actions is the same token as
  `THOR.RUJI`.
- Descriptions keep Midgard's notation (`BTC/BTC`, `BTC~BTC`, `ETH-USDC`).

## Config

Trade and secured assets can be prefixed instead, per kind, in the config:

```toml
[assets]
prefixSecuredAssets = true   # ETH-USDC → ThorSecured.ETH.USDC (default false: USDC)
prefixTradeAssets = true     # BTC~BTC  → ThorTrade.BTC.BTC   (default false: BTC)
```

Both are optional; a config without `[assets]` exports L1 names. Synths are
always prefixed. On Maya the prefix is `Maya` (`MayaSecured.BTC.BTC`).

Summ does not recognise the synth names, so their value comes from the CSV's
reference price columns where a row has them (swaps carry Midgard's USD
prices).

## History

- Before April 2026 a synth was exported as its ticker (`BTC`).
- April 2026 to October 2026: a synth was `BTC.BTC`, which reads like L1 BTC;
  trade and secured assets had the L1 chain as their blockchain; `x/ruji` was
  `X.RUJI`.
- Before April 2026 every THORChain row had `THOR` as its blockchain.
- April 2026 to October 2026: most rows had `THORChain`, but liquidity
  deposit and withdrawal rows and sends kept Midgard's chain id
  (`THOR`, `MAYA`) for a protocol-native asset, so Summ gave them no chain.

A holding open when its name changes splits into two balances in Summ (the
old name goes negative). Check positions open across a re-export.
