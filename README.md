# thorchain-cryptotax

Exports the activity of your THORChain and Maya Protocol wallets as CSV files
for [Summ](https://cryptotaxcalculator.io/?via=glaj5hf5) (formerly Crypto Tax
Calculator), in its advanced CSV format.

It maps source data (Midgard, THORNode, Viewblock) to rows: what each wallet
sent, received, deposited and withdrew, and the fee it paid. It does not
price rows or compute gains: Summ does. Where a treatment is a tax choice
(e.g. the Maya liquidity auction), the config makes it, and each spec says
which values are observed on-chain and which are assumed.

## What's supported

- **THORChain swaps** (including streaming swaps with an unfilled part
  returned) and **refunds**: [fees.md](docs/specs/fees.md)
- **Liquidity** (add and withdraw): [liquidity.md](docs/specs/liquidity.md)
- **Savers**: [savers.md](docs/specs/savers.md)
- **Lending** (loan open and repayment): [loans.md](docs/specs/loans.md)
- **Sends and receives**, including income from configured senders and sends
  from before April 2022 via Viewblock: [sends.md](docs/specs/sends.md)
- **Bond and unbond, RUNEPool, TCY** (claim, stake, unstake, distributions),
  **THORNames**, and **switches** (BEP2 RUNE upgrade, KUJI):
  [activity.md](docs/specs/activity.md)
- **Synths, trade and secured assets**, and how every asset is named:
  [assets.md](docs/specs/assets.md)
- **Fees**: which fee goes on which row: [fees.md](docs/specs/fees.md)
- **Maya Protocol** (swaps, liquidity, refunds, sends), including the
  [2023 liquidity auction](docs/specs/maya.md#liquidity-auction-2023):
  [maya.md](docs/specs/maya.md)
- **Rujira**: staking (bond), FIN market swaps, merge deposit and withdraw:
  [rujira.md](docs/specs/rujira.md)
- **Periods and row IDs**: one CSV per wallet per period, in your time zone,
  with stable row IDs: [periods.md](docs/specs/periods.md)
- **Actions that are not final** (pending, stuck refunds):
  [pending.md](docs/specs/pending.md)
- **Run summaries** and comparing two runs:
  [run-summary.md](docs/specs/run-summary.md), [run-diff.md](docs/specs/run-diff.md)
- **Snapshots and offline replay**: every downloaded record is stored, so a
  run can be replayed without network access:
  [snapshots.md](docs/specs/snapshots.md)
- **Summ sync** (experimental): plans and applies the changes that make Summ
  match a run, through Summ's MCP server:
  [summ-sync.md](docs/specs/summ-sync.md),
  [packages/summ-sync](packages/summ-sync/README.md)

## Not supported yet

- Failed actions (only their fee moved): listed, not exported.
- Bond rewards; Maya bonding; CACAO yield paid to MAYA token holders.
- Fees paid on Maya inbound transactions.
- Rujira unbonding, staking revenue claims, FIN orders, BOW, GHOST and other
  Rujira contracts. Levana perps are discontinued: enter positions by hand
  ([rujira.md](docs/specs/rujira.md#levana)).
- The conversion of open savers positions to TCY in January 2025.
- Aggregated swaps (routed through more than THORChain).

A run never drops what it can't map: each such action is saved under
`unsupported/` (or `failures/`) in the run's output folder and listed in its
`summary.md`.

## Run it

You don't have to run the commands yourself. You can ask a coding agent (e.g.
[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)) to clone this repo, set up a
config with your wallets, run the export and explain the output. Keep the
config and the output in a private folder outside the clone, so your wallets
never end up in the repo.

By hand:

1. Install Node at the version in [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) (`nvm install && nvm use`).
2. `npm ci --ignore-scripts`
3. Copy [`wallets-config.toml`](wallets-config.toml) to a folder outside the
   repo, e.g. `../my-tax/wallets-config.toml`, and add your wallets and dates.
4. `node src/full-export.ts ../my-tax/wallets-config.toml`

Output, cache and summary are written next to the config. Add `--offline` to
re-run from the cache without network access. Details:
[docs/nodejs-instructions.md](docs/nodejs-instructions.md).
